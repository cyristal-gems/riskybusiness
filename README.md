# 📌 About Me
I bring over **5 years of hands-on experience** in threat detection, incident management, and security operations with a proven track record of identifying and mitigating security risks—implementing advanced security protocols and leveraging real-time intelligence to strengthen organizational defenses and safeguard critical infrastructures. 

Now, I'm developing my expertise in **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** with a focus on industry standards and security frameworks. My goal is to help organizations manage risks and meet compliance requirements by combining my technical background with strategic risk management insights.
